<h2>Welcome Testers</h2><br />
<h3>We are currently testing Common Change Alpha</h3>


<p class="text-med">Thank you for taking time to test this version of the Common Change application. Your responses will help us to ensure that the software is user friendly, does what it needs to, and is error free on launch.</p>

<p class="text-med">This is an Alpha version of the software, which means that there are some sections that simply do not yet exist and there are guaranteed to be things that don't operate as expected. Thanks for your patience during these early stages of testing.</p>
